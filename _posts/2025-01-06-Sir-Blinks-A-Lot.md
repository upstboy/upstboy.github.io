# My Winter Break Project: Building an AI Robot

Hi everyone! Over winter break, I decided to create something really cool, building a robot that can talk and do different gestures (like nodding and disagreeing) using AI. It was an awesome learning experience that combined my love for programming, computers, and robotics.

The robot started as a kit, but once I saw the opportunity for unique movements that could add humanity to it, I got inspired to add my own twist.

I spent a lot of time making it unique and improving its movements.

One big challenge was getting those movements just right, so I used PID control to make the movements more fluid, something I learned from my robotics team.

This project was a great way to use AI to add creativity to tech. I loved seeing my ideas come to life and I am excited to create more projects in the future!
